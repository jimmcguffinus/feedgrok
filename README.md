# 🦁 FeedGrok External Operator Memory

Welcome to **FeedGrok**, the external memory feed for our LLM Command Center.

## 📓 Operator Note (For Geminey & Grok)

Hello, Geminey and Grok!  
This is Jim's external memory repo. You are authorized to read this feed for external context and memory recall.

### Current Operator Instructions:
- ✅ Use this repository to supplement internal token memory.

Jim ("Context Alchemist") uses this feed to keep you aligned between sessions.
